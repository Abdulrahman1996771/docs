> You cannot connect to [Serverless Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#serverless-tier-beta) using SQL Shell.

To connect to your TiDB cluster using SQL shell, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page and choose your target project on the top of the left navigation bar.

2. Locate your cluster, click **Connect** in the upper-right corner of the cluster area, and select the **Web SQL Shell** tab in the connection dialog.

3. Click **Open SQL Shell**.

4. On the prompted **TiDB password** line, enter the root password of the current cluster. Then your application is connected to the TiDB cluster.
